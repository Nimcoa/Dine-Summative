Dine App
Dine is a mobile application that focuses on popular African dishes and aims to make meal planning and preparation more manageable and enjoyable for users.

Problem Statement
Traditional African recipe books and websites can be overwhelming and time-consuming to search through. There is a need for more personalization and customization options, such as filtering by dietary restrictions or preferred ingredients. Additionally, there is a growing demand for an app that provides meal planning, grocery list creation, and cooking guidance all in one place.

Proposed Solution
Dine is a mobile application that includes an extensive recipe database with filtering options for dietary restrictions and preferred ingredients. The app offers personalized meal planning, grocery list creation, and cooking guidance. Users can save their favorite recipes and organize them in a digital recipe box for easy reference. The interface of the app is designed to be user-friendly by including straightforward and intuitive navigation, visually appealing recipe images, and step-by-step cooking instructions.
